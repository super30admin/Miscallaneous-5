## Problem 1: Find Consecutive Ones(https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)


## Problems 2 : Remove all the continuous character (https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/)

Given a string we have to remove all the continuous character whose count is more than 2.
For example :
1. abba ----> abba
2. abbb---->a is the output because c count is 3.
3. abbbaa---> '' empty string
4. abbacccaa--->abbHere relative order of characters and their counts must be maintained so we figured out that we cannot use hashtable.
Give a solution better than O(n^2).
